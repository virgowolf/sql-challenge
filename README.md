# sql-challenge
For this assignment, I created an HR database and analyzed it with PostgreSQL. The project included data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
Database schemata were created using Quick DBD at https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/.
Six separate csv files were imported into PG Admin 4 to run queries.
This project was completed in April 2024 as a requirement for the UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp.
Assistance was provided by the AI tool called "Xpert Learning Assistant".
